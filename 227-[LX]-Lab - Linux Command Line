Lab Exercises
Exercise 1: File System Navigation
bash# Navigate to home directory
cd ~

# List files with detailed information
ls -la

# Show current working directory
pwd

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p projects/lab1/data
Exercise 2: File Operations
bash# Create a new file
touch example.txt

# Copy files
cp example.txt backup.txt

# Move/rename files
mv backup.txt example_backup.txt

# Remove files
rm example_backup.txt
Exercise 3: Text Processing
bash# View file contents
cat filename.txt

# Search within files
grep "pattern" filename.txt

# Count lines, words, characters
wc filename.txt

# Sort file contents
sort filename.txt

# Display first/last lines
head -n 10 filename.txt
tail -n 10 filename.txt
Exercise 4: File Permissions
bash# Check file permissions
ls -l filename.txt

# Change file permissions
chmod 755 filename.txt

# Change file ownership
chown user:group filename.txt
Exercise 5: Process Management
bash# List running processes
ps aux

# Display system processes
top

# Kill a process
kill PID

# Run process in background
command &

# Check system resources
df -h
free -h
Exercise 6: Archive and Compression
