235-[LX]-Lab: Working with Files

Overview

This lab focuses on file management tasks on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance using SSH. It involves creating a backup of a folder structure, logging the backup details, and transferring the backup file to another directory.

Duration: Approximately 30 minutes

Objectives





Create a backup of an entire folder structure using tar.



Log the backup creation with date, time, and file name in a file.



Transfer the backup file to another folder.

Prerequisites





Access to the AWS Management Console.



SSH utility (e.g., PuTTY for Windows or terminal for macOS/Linux).



Familiarity with basic Linux commands.

Environment Setup

The lab environment includes the following folder structure under /home/ec2-user/:

/home/ec2-user/CompanyA/
├── Employees/
│   └── Schedules.csv
├── Finance/
│   └── Salary.csv
├── HR/
│   ├── Assessments.csv
│   └── Managers.csv
├── IA/
├── Management/
│   ├── Promotions.csv
│   └── Sections.csv
└── SharedFolders.csv

Task 1: Connect to Amazon Linux EC2 Instance via SSH





Access the AWS Management Console:





Choose Start Lab and wait for lab status: ready.



Open the AWS console by selecting AWS.



For Windows users:





Download the labsuser.ppk file from the Details menu.



Note the PublicIP address.



Use PuTTY to connect (configure as per AWS documentation).



For macOS/Linux users:





Use the terminal with the provided SSH key and PublicIP.

Task 2: Create a Backup





Verify the current directory:

pwd

Expected Output:

/home/ec2-user



Validate the CompanyA folder structure:

ls -R CompanyA

Expected Output:

CompanyA/:
Employees Finance HR IA Management SharedFolders

CompanyA/Employees:
Schedules.csv

CompanyA/Finance:
Salary.csv

CompanyA/HR:
Assessments.csv Managers.csv

CompanyA/IA:

CompanyA/Management:
Promotions.csv Sections.csv



Create a compressed backup of the CompanyA folder:

tar -cvpzf backup.CompanyA.tar.gz CompanyA

Expected Output:

CompanyA/
CompanyA/Management/
CompanyA/Management/Sections.csv
CompanyA/Management/Promotions.csv
CompanyA/Employees/
CompanyA/Employees/Schedules.csv
CompanyA/Finance/
CompanyA/Finance/Salary.csv
CompanyA/HR/
CompanyA/HR/Managers.csv
CompanyA/HR/Assessments.csv
CompanyA/IA/
CompanyA/SharedFolders/



Verify the backup file:

ls

Expected Output:

backup.CompanyA.tar.gz CompanyA

Task 3: Log the Backup





Navigate to the CompanyA folder:

cd /home/ec2-user/CompanyA



Create an empty backups.csv file:

touch SharedFolders/backups.csv



Log the backup details (date, time, file name):

echo "25 Aug 25 2021, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar.gz" | sudo tee SharedFolders/backups.csv

Expected Output:

25 Aug 25 2021, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar.gz



Display the log file content:

cat SharedFolders/backups.csv

Expected Output:

25 Aug 25 2021, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar.gz

Task 4: Move the Backup File





Confirm the current directory:

pwd

Expected Output:

/home/ec2-user/CompanyA



Move the backup file to the IA folder:

mv ../backup.CompanyA.tar.gz IA/



Verify the file was moved:

ls IA

Expected Output:

backup.CompanyA.tar.gz

Lab Completion





End the lab by selecting End Lab and confirming with Yes.



Close the panel using the X button.

Notes





The tee command writes output to both the terminal and a file, used with the | redirector.



AWS service restrictions may limit actions to those required for the lab.



The backup file (backup.CompanyA.tar.gz) can be copied and extracted to restore the folder structure elsewhere.

Conclusion

This lab demonstrates essential file management skills on a Linux EC2 instance, including creating compressed backups, logging operations, and transferring files. These tasks are fundamental for system administration and data management in cloud environments.
