AWS Linux File System Lab

This document outlines the steps for completing the "Working with the File System" lab, which involves creating and managing a folder structure on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance using SSH. The lab focuses on file and directory manipulation using Linux commands.

Objectives

In this lab, you will:





Create a folder structure as specified



Create files



Copy and move files and directories



Delete files and directories

Duration

Approximately 30 minutes

Prerequisites





Access to the AWS Management Console



An SSH client (e.g., PuTTY for Windows or terminal for macOS/Linux)



Basic familiarity with Linux commands

Task 1: Connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance





Access the AWS Management Console:





Choose Start Lab to launch the lab environment.



Wait for the Lab status: ready message, then close the Start Lab panel.



Open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab (allow pop-ups if necessary).



SSH Connection (Windows Users):





From the Details menu, select Show to view credentials.



Download the labsuser.ppk file and note the PublicIP address.



Use PuTTY to connect to the EC2 instance (refer to AWS documentation for configuration details).



SSH Connection (macOS/Linux Users):





Use the terminal to SSH into the instance with the provided credentials and PublicIP.

Task 2: Create a Folder Structure

Create the following folder structure and files on the Linux machine:

/home/ec2-user/CompanyA/
├── Finance/
│   ├── ProfitAndLossStatements.csv
│   └── Salary.csv
├── HR/
│   ├── Assessments.csv
│   └── TrialPeriod.csv
├── Management/
│   ├── Managers.csv
│   └── Schedule.csv

Steps





Verify you are in the home directory:

pwd

If not, navigate to /home/ec2-user:

cd /home/ec2-user



Create the top-level folder:

mkdir CompanyA



Navigate to the CompanyA directory:

cd CompanyA



Create subfolders:

mkdir Finance HR Management



Verify subfolders:

ls

Expected output: Finance HR Management



Create files in the HR folder:

cd HR
touch Assessments.csv TrialPeriod.csv
ls

Expected output: Assessments.csv TrialPeriod.csv



Create files in the Finance folder:

cd ../Finance
touch Salary.csv ProfitAndLossStatements.csv
ls

Expected output: Salary.csv ProfitAndLossStatements.csv



Create files in the Management folder from CompanyA:

cd ..
touch Management/Managers.csv Management/Schedule.csv
ls Management

Expected output: Managers.csv Schedule.csv



Validate the entire structure:

ls -lR

Task 3: Delete and Reorganize Folders

Reorganize the folder structure as follows:





Copy the Finance folder and its contents to the HR folder, then remove the original Finance folder.



Move the Management folder to the HR folder.



Create an Employees folder inside HR and move Assessments.csv and TrialPeriod.csv into it.

Steps





Ensure you are in the CompanyA directory:

pwd

Output: /home/ec2-user/CompanyA



Copy the Finance folder to HR:

cp -r Finance HR
ls HR/Finance

Expected output: ProfitAndLossStatements.csv Salary.csv



Remove the original Finance folder:

rm Finance/ProfitAndLossStatements.csv Finance/Salary.csv
ls Finance

Expected output: (empty)

rmdir Finance
ls

Expected output: HR Management



Move the Management folder to HR:

mv Management HR
ls HR/Management

Expected output: Managers.csv Schedule.csv



Create the Employees folder and move files:

cd HR
mkdir Employees
mv Assessments.csv TrialPeriod.csv Employees
ls Employees

Expected output: Assessments.csv TrialPeriod.csv

Final Structure

The resulting structure should be:

/home/ec2-user/CompanyA/
└── HR/
    ├── Employees/
    │   ├── Assessments.csv
    │   └── TrialPeriod.csv
    ├── Finance/
    │   ├── ProfitAndLossStatements.csv
    │   └── Salary.csv
    ├── Management/
    │   ├── Managers.csv
    │   └── Schedule.csv

Lab Completion





Verify all steps are complete.



End the lab in the AWS Management Console by selecting End Lab and confirming with Yes.

Notes





The touch command creates empty files.



The ls command lists directory contents; use ls -lR for a recursive listing.



Use rmdir for empty directories or rm -r for non-empty directories.



The cp -r command copies directories recursively, and mv moves files or directories.

This lab was completed successfully, demonstrating proficiency in Linux file system operations on an AWS EC2 instance.
