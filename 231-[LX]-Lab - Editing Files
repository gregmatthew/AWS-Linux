# Lab: Editing Files in Linux (Vim and Nano)

## Overview
This lab focused on learning basic file editing in Linux using two popular text editors: **Vim** and **Nano**. The exercises included creating, editing, and saving files, as well as practicing essential commands in both editors.

## Lab Objectives
- Use `vimtutor` to complete introductory tasks (Lessons 1-3).
- Create and edit files in **Vim** (`helloworld`).
- Create and edit files in **Nano** (`cloudworld`).
- Practice essential commands (e.g., saving, quitting, undo, line deletion).

---

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Connect to Amazon Linux EC2 Instance
- Connected to an EC2 instance via SSH (PuTTY for Windows users).
- Retrieved credentials and public IP address from the lab environment.

### Task 2: Run the Vim Tutorial (`vimtutor`)
- Executed `vimtutor` in the terminal to learn Vim basics.
- Completed Lessons 1-3, covering:
  - Cursor movement (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
  - Insert mode (`i`), saving (`:w`), and quitting (`:q`).
- Exited the tutorial with `:q!`.

### Task 3: Edit a File in Vim
1. Created a file named `helloworld` using `vim helloworld`.
2. Added the following text in insert mode (`i`):
Hello world!
This is my first file in Linux and I am editing it in Vim!

text
3. Saved changes with `:wq` and reopened the file to append:
I learned how to create a file, edit and save them too!

text
4. Practiced advanced commands:
- Delete line: `dd`
- Undo: `u`
- Save without quitting: `:w`

### Task 4: Edit a File in Nano
1. Created a file named `cloudworld` using `nano cloudworld`.
2. Added text directly (no insert mode required):
We are using nano this time! We can simply start typing! No insert mode needed.

text
3. Saved with `Ctrl+O` and exited with `Ctrl+X`.
4. Verified the file content by reopening it in Nano.
