Linux Users and Groups Lab
Overview
This lab demonstrates fundamental user and group management operations in Linux systems. The exercises cover creating, modifying, and managing user accounts and groups, as well as understanding permission systems.
Lab Objectives

Create and manage user accounts
Create and manage groups
Assign users to groups
Modify user properties
Understand file permissions and ownership
Practice sudo configuration

Prerequisites

Linux system with root/sudo access
Basic command line knowledge
Understanding of Linux file system structure

Lab Exercises
Exercise 1: User Account Management
1.1 Create New Users
bash# Create user accounts
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash alice
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash bob
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash charlie

# Set passwords for users
sudo passwd alice
sudo passwd bob
sudo passwd charlie
1.2 View User Information
bash# Display user information
id alice
cat /etc/passwd | grep alice
finger alice  # if finger is installed
1.3 Modify User Accounts
bash# Change user's shell
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh alice

# Change user's home directory
sudo usermod -d /home/alice_new -m alice

# Lock/unlock user account
sudo usermod -L bob    # Lock
sudo usermod -U bob    # Unlock
Exercise 2: Group Management
2.1 Create Groups
bash# Create new groups
sudo groupadd developers
sudo groupadd admins
sudo groupadd users_group
2.2 Add Users to Groups
bash# Add users to groups
sudo usermod -a -G developers alice
sudo usermod -a -G developers bob
sudo usermod -a -G admins alice
sudo usermod -a -G users_group charlie
2.3 View Group Information
bash# Display group information
groups alice
cat /etc/group | grep developers
getent group developers
Exercise 3: File Permissions and Ownership
3.1 Create Test Files and Directories
bash# Create test directory structure
sudo mkdir -p /shared/{developers,admins,general}
sudo touch /shared/developers/project1.txt
sudo touch /shared/admins/config.txt
sudo touch /shared/general/readme.txt
3.2 Set Ownership and Permissions
bash# Set group ownership
sudo chgrp developers /shared/developers
sudo chgrp admins /shared/admins
sudo chgrp users_group /shared/general

# Set permissions
sudo chmod 770 /shared/developers
sudo chmod 750 /shared/admins
sudo chmod 755 /shared/general

# Set file ownership
sudo chown alice:developers /shared/developers/project1.txt
sudo chown root:admins /shared/admins/config.txt
sudo chown charlie:users_group /shared/general/readme.txt
Exercise 4: Advanced User Management
4.1 User Account Policies
bash# Set password expiry
sudo chage -M 90 alice  # Max 90 days
sudo chage -W 7 alice   # Warn 7 days before expiry

# View password information
sudo chage -l alice
4.2 Sudo Configuration
bash# Add user to sudo group
sudo usermod -a -G sudo alice

# Create custom sudo rule (edit /etc/sudoers)
# alice ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl status *
Exercise 5: Verification and Testing
5.1 Test User Access
bash# Switch users and test permissions
su - alice
cd /shared/developers
touch test_file.txt
exit

su - bob
cd /shared/developers
ls -la
exit
5.2 Verify Group Memberships
bash# Check all group memberships
for user in alice bob charlie; do
    echo "Groups for $user:"
    groups $user
    echo
done
Lab Results
Created Users

alice: Developer user with admin privileges
bob: Developer user
charlie: General user

Created Groups

developers: For development team members
admins: For system administrators
users_group: For general users

Key Commands Used
User Management

useradd - Add user accounts
usermod - Modify user accounts
userdel - Delete user accounts
passwd - Set user passwords
chage - Change password aging information

Group Management

groupadd - Add groups
groupmod - Modify groups
groupdel - Delete groups
groups - Show user group memberships
getent group - Display group information

Permission Management

chmod - Change file permissions
chown - Change file ownership
chgrp - Change group ownership
ls -l - List files with permissions

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Permission Denied: Ensure user has proper group membership
User Already Exists: Check existing users with cat /etc/passwd
Group Not Found: Verify group exists with getent group

Cleanup Commands
bash# Remove test users
sudo userdel -r alice
sudo userdel -r bob
sudo userdel -r charlie

# Remove test groups
sudo groupdel developers
sudo groupdel admins
sudo groupdel users_group

# Remove test directories
sudo rm -rf /shared
